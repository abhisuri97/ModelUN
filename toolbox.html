                            <h2>Research</h2>
                            <p>The best way to start research is to figure out your countries stance on the topic at hand. Here are some useful links to get started on the basics of your country. Use whatever statistics you think will help you prove your point on the subject. Use any other websites.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:center"><a class="buttonfancy2" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/"> <b>CIA World Factbook</b></a>

                            <p>
                            Make sure you fully understand your countries stance on the topic as well as potentially friendly or unfriendly countries to yours.
                            
                            Read your committees background guide carefully and research your countries beliefs specifically on the committee topic.
                            It will also be useful to understand your countries socio-economic status and research some statistics for your countries imports and exports.
                           
                                Feel free to expand your research options to journals and recent news as well.
                           
                            Finally, make sure you are constantly thinking about a resolution to you committees problem.

Topic: “Strengthening UN coordination of humanitarian assistance in complex emergencies”<br></p>

The General Assembly,<br>
<b>[The first section of the resolution is the preamble, which points out the problem and background information on the topic. Each clause starts with a preambulatory phrase (see list below) and ends with a comma. A resolution typically has three to five preambulatory clauses.]</b><br>
Noting with satisfaction the past efforts of various relevant UN bodies and nongovernmental organizations,<br>
Stressing the fact that the United Nations faces significant financial obstacles and is in need of reform, particularly in the humanitarian realm,<br>
                                <b>
[The second part of the resolution comprises operative clauses, which propose the actions that delegates believe need to be taken to address the topic. Just as with the preamble, each clause in this section starts with an operative phrase (see below) and ends with a semicolon, except the last clause, which will end with a period. The number of operative clauses depends on the sponsors; resolutions should have as many clauses as necessary to get the point across.]</b>
                                <br>
1. Encourages all relevant agencies of the United Nations to collaborate more closely with countries at the grassroots level to enhance the carrying out of relief efforts;<br>
2. Urges member states to comply with the goals of the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs to streamline efforts of humanitarian aid;<br>
                                3. Calls upon states to respond quickly and generously to consolidated appeals for humanitarian assistance.
